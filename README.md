# BucketCatcher

Fast bruteforce and wordlist attack to find open s3 buckets
Written in C to maximize the speed of execution, making a brute force attack no longer something utopian, and making it possible to implement with CUDA cores and multi-threads in the future.

Please note: although the tool is usable, it is not complete and may have bugs.

## Easy to use
